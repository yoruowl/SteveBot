this is a bot for scraping all of the messages for a specified user in a specified discord server and outputting it into a file friendly for finetuning an LLM

how to run your own instance:
- go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
- create a new application and name it whatever you want
- under the "bot" section make sure to enable "server members intent" and "message content intent"

I'll finish this later
